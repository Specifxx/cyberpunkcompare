# Decisions

Newest at the bottom. The engine's own history (the lean Rift Compare
playbook, eBay planning, matching rules, caching, forum, reports, seasons) is
in the sister repos' DECISIONS.md (`Specifxx/GundamCompare`,
`Specifxx/lorcanacompare`, `Specifxx/ygocompare`); code comments that cite a
DECISIONS heading mean theirs unless it is below.

## Why a Cyberpunk TCG site — 2026-11-01

Owner asked whether Cyberpunk TCG was worth a site after affiliate sales of
Cyberpunk cards showed up (most likely RiftCompare visitors buying on eBay
within the 24-hour cookie). Research the same day: WeirdCo's Kickstarter
raised US$28.35M from 50,773 backers (the most-funded tabletop campaign);
Beta print shipped September 2026, retail release 6 November 2026; WeirdCo
will not reprint a set or configuration; the Beta box (US$180 MSRP) sold
around US$315 on TCGplayer in October with 223 eBay sales in 90 days.
TCGplayer lists it (category 92, since 31 August), Cardmarket supports it in
Europe. Of the 1,240 stores the sister sites track, 1,136 answered and 392
listed Cyberpunk TCG (243 with three or more products). No site compared store
prices for it (CHOOMDEX shows eBay and TCGplayer only). Owner: build it,
domain cyberpunkcompare.com.

Risks taken knowingly: a brand-new game with no track record and no date for
set 2; "Cyberpunk" in the domain is CD PROJEKT's trademark (owner's call).

## Beta and Retail are separate products, told apart by the title — 2026-11-01

TCGplayer lists Welcome to Night City twice, "- Beta" and "- Retail", with
identical card and sealed names, and the Beta box costs about twice the Retail
one. A Beta price on the Retail box's page (or the reverse) is the worst kind
of wrong match, and the 0.25×–4× plausibility guard cannot catch a 2× error.

Engine option `SITE.setEditions` (off for the other games): the edition word
is removed from set and sealed names for matching, and a title's edition must
equal the product's. A title is Beta when it says "Beta", "36 packs" or
"Kickstarter"/"backer"; otherwise it is Retail (the default edition) because
stores selling the release-week box call it plain "Booster Box"; a title that
points at both matches neither. The eBay pass applies the same rule, and its
searches name the edition only for Beta. Pinned by `tests/set-editions.test.ts`.

## Rarity codes spelled out — 2026-11-01

TCGplayer stores Cyberpunk TCG rarities as codes (C, UC, R, E, S, IL, IO, IS,
NR). Engine option `SITE.rarityNames` maps them at import, so pages, filters
and rarity matching read "Iconic Legend", not "IL". IO is "Iconic" (TCGplayer's
"other" Iconic cards); NR is Nova Rare (promos, box toppers, event prizes).

## Its own eBay app — 2026-11-01

Owner: Cyberpunk Compare gets a new eBay keyset; Gundam, Lorcana and YGO keep
their shared app and budgets unchanged. `dailyBudget` 2,500 (half a keyset, so
it can take a second site), cards from US$10, every sealed product. Runs at
00:17 UTC. A no-op until the secrets exist.

## 2026-11-02 — Self-updating price report

The owner wants growth that runs without him ("a more passive, working in the background solution"): no daily Reddit
posts. Links are the passive lever, and outreach needs a page worth linking to. `/price-report` is that page: one URL
for good, rebuilt from the committed data every release (`src/lib/market-report.ts`, pure, tested), so nobody writes
it. It says how often a US store undercuts TCGplayer's market price on cards from $5 and sealed from $10 (USD against
USD, never converted), lists the most valuable sealed products a US store has in stock (cases left out: almost none
are stocked), counts products in stock per market, shows the 30-day movers (7-day until a month of history exists) and
ends with a citation line. `revalidate = 86400`, in the sitemap and footer. The daily outreach task offers it to
writers and creators.

## 2026-11-02 — Black Friday page

`/black-friday` lists today's in-stock US store prices 8–60% under TCGplayer's market price (the same
`deals()` as the homepage and Deal Finder, stores only: eBay and Amazon rows are left out), sealed first, then cards, one row per product. One URL kept
every year so links and rankings carry over; it must be indexed weeks before the day (27 November 2026),
so it ships now. The homepage links it from 1 November to a week after Cyber Monday; the footer and
sitemap always do. Never a "was" price, a countdown, "ends soon" or an invented sale: we only know what a
store asked when we last read it. Dates and the split are pure (`src/lib/black-friday.ts`, tests in
`tests/black-friday.test.ts`). Part of the passive-growth plan (owner, 2026-11-02: no daily Reddit posts).

## 2026-11-02 — Free price widgets

`/embed/card/<slug>` is a live price badge any blog, deck guide or store can put in an `<iframe>`: the cheapest in-stock
store price in the chosen market (`?market=`, US by default; never TCGplayer, eBay, Amazon or a pre-order), else
TCGplayer's market price labelled as such. `/embed` lists the snippet (the iframe plus one plain text link, the only
part search engines credit) and a plain-HTML badge for the stores we compare. The daily outreach offers the widget
instead of asking for a link (owner, 2026-11-02: growth must be passive). The badge is a route handler reading only
`src/lib/data.ts`, noindex, cached a day by its CDN header; a missing slug answers 404 with a 5-minute cache.
RiftCompare has had the same widgets since 2026-09.

## 2026-11-02 — The monitor reports to Empire HQ; only red mails

The owner asked for one Monday email instead of a mail per site (the control tower, approved 2026-11-02). The ops
monitor now writes every result to `ops-status.json`, and its workflow force-pushes it as `status.json`, one orphan
commit, to this repo's public `ops-status` branch (never deployed, `vercel.json`). RiftCompare's ops monitor reads it
every three hours for Empire HQ (riftcompare.com/admin/hq) and the one Monday report, and mails the owner itself if
the file goes quiet for a day (a stopped monitor cannot mail). Only a FAILED check fails the run, which is GitHub's
email to the owner; warnings wait for HQ and Monday. The file carries status and the monitor's own sentences only,
the same as the public Actions log.

## 2026-11-02 — Price alerts through RiftCompare's shared service

The owner chose "Yes, one shared service" for email price alerts on the sister sites. This reverses part of
"No accounts, no database, no email" (2026-10-25): the site still has no accounts, no database and no mail key, but
the card page now has an "Email me when the price drops" form.

- **The form** (`components/PriceAlertForm.tsx`, the same file on every sister site; `PriceAlert.tsx` picks the
  visitor's market) posts `{site, productId, region, email, targetCents}` straight to
  `https://riftcompare.com/api/sister-alerts`. RiftCompare keeps the address (its own Neon project, private tables),
  sends one confirmation email (double opt-in), then checks daily. This site stores nothing and holds no key.
- **The prices** come from this site's own static `/alert-feed.json` (`lib/alert-feed.ts`), built with each deploy
  from the same files the pages read: per product, the lowest in-stock store or TCGplayer offer in each market, in
  that market's currency, never eBay, never converted; plus up to five of the site's own deals (store price under
  TCGplayer market) that another card site's alert email may end with. Served from the CDN (`revalidate` 86400),
  so it costs no function call.
- **Behind `SITE.priceAlerts`** (on for Gundam, Lorcana, YGO and Cyberpunk); the site's `key` must be registered in
  RiftCompare's `lib/sister-alerts/sites.ts`. The privacy page says what the form sends and links to RiftCompare's.
- RiftCompare's `sister-alerts.yml` fails (and its ops monitor reports it) when a site with alerts serves no fresh
  feed, so a broken feed here shows up there.
